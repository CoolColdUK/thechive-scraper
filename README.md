# thechive-scraper
This simple scraper written in Node.js to download all the images that are there in thechive.com. Thus saving lots of us folks a lot of manual Right Click>Save Image work. Enjoy.

You will need the Node.js installed on your system to be able to use this.
Besides that, you will need the "request" and "cheerio" modules to request the HTML and process it.

This is my first post in GitHub, Modifications and suggestions are more than welcome.
